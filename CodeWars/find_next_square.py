# You might know some pretty large perfect squares.But what about the NEXT one?

# Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect
# square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect
# square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

# If the parameter is itself not a perfect square, than -1 should be returned.
# You may assume the parameter is positive.

# Examples:

# findNextSquare(121) --> returns 144
# findNextSquare(625) --> returns 676
# findNextSquare(114) --> returns -1 since 114 is not a perfect
